# Poll Prediction
This repository contains an analysis project focused on predicting polling results using bootstrapping methods.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use bootstrapping techniques to estimate the mean and confidence intervals for polling data. The analysis is implemented in R and Python, leveraging both languages' powerful libraries for statistical computation and data manipulation.

## Content
- poll_prediction.Rmd: The main R Markdown file containing the analysis code.
- Data: The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a public repository on GitHub.

# Setup
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have libraries installed before the recreation 
R - boot, reticulate, dplyr

Python - pandas 

## Running the analysis
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/poll_prediction.git

2. Open the R Markdown file poll_prediction.Rmd in RStudio.
3. Ensure you have all the required packages installed (see Prerequisites).
4. Run the R Markdown file to execute the analysis and generate the HTML report.
